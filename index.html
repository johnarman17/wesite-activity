                    <p>Hi, my name is John Arman and I am currently in 2nd year in Catanduanes State University, I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor, i love watching anime, listening to music, and playing basketball. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great.
                         It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. 
                         I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.
                    </p>
